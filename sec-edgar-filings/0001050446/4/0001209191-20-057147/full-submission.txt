POWER OF ATTORNEY

Know all by these presents, that the undersigned hereby constitutes and appoints
each of W. Ming Shao and Jeff Wigfield, signing singly, the undersigned's true
and lawful attorney-in-fact to:

(1) execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the undersigned's capacity
as an officer and/or director of MicroStrategy Incorporated (the "Company"),
Forms 3, 4, and 5 in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 and the rules thereunder;

(2) do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned which
may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such Form 3, 4, or 5
and timely file such form with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission and any stock exchange or similar authority; and

(3) take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit to,
and in the best interest of, or legally required by, the undersigned, it being
understood that the documents executed by such attorney-in-fact on behalf of the
undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall be in such form and shall
contain such terms and conditions as such attorney-in-fact may approve in such
attorney-in-fact's discretion.

The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full power and
authority to do and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever requisite,
necessary, or proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights and powers
herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as the undersigned might or
could do if personally present, with full power of substitution or revocation,
hereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney-in-fact, or such
attorney-in-fact's substitute or substitutes, shall lawfully do or cause to be
done by virtue of this Power of Attorney and the rights and powers herein
granted. The undersigned acknowledges that the foregoing attorneys-in-fact, in
serving in such capacity at the request of the undersigned, are not assuming,
nor is the Company assuming, any of the undersigned's responsibilities to comply
with, or the undersigned's liability under, Section 16 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.

This Power of Attorney supersedes any and all previous Powers of Attorney
relating to Form 3, 4, and 5 filings in the undersigned's capacity as an officer
and/or director of the Company, and shall remain in full force and effect until
